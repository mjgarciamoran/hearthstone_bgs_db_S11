# Hearthstone Battlegrounds Leaderboard Database - Season 11 - 08/2025

Hearthstone is an online card game developed by Blizzard Entertainment.  
Data related to player rating is publicly published in public leaderboards on their website. There's an API to access it.
Players and their rankings are distributed between two gamemodes and three regions.
Data is fetched every 6 minutes for each combination of gamemode and region.

Early days of the database are missing due to my own incompetence.

Previews

Season 11 corresponds to season 16 internally in Hearthstone's API.
